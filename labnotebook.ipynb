    "HEK293 cell culture plate (prepared by course personnel) was given to us. We confirmed with bright-field microscope that the cells are adhered to the plate. Old media was aspirated, 1 ml trypsin-EDTA pipetted onto the plate, and incubated for 1 min 37°C. Cell detachment was confirmed with microscope. 5 ml of full DMEM (p. 6; prepared by other students) was added to the plate and mixed by pipetting back and forth. The cell suspension was then centrifuged (300 g, 5 min) in a 15 ml Falcon tube. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 500 µl of full DMEM.\n",
